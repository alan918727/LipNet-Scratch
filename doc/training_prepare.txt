the prepare program is to create the training folders and its dataset


it reads the datasets video path and align path(can be anywhere in other directory)

and extract the speaker_id, s_id, video_id


then it create the folder format like 

CURRENT_PATH, speaker_id, 'datasets', 'val', s_id, video_id
CURRENT_PATH, speaker_id, 'datasets', 'train', s_id, video_id

for train datasets and val datasets

then it make symbolic link which link the current_path videos to the video datasets. the current aligns to the datasets align path
